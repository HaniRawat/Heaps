# Heaps
Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions related to heaps. Heaps are a fundamental data structure in computer science, characterized by their tree-based structure where the parent node is either greater than (in a max heap) or less than (in a min heap) its child nodes. I am using the Coder Army Sheet for these questions [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pud-vdSPhhljScynHvTUGRE5yxEV6dCMb45rOwoSt_Q/edit#gid=0).
